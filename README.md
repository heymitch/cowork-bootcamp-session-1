# Organize Machine

Your first agent skill. Organize files on your computer using GTD principles — scan screenshots, sort downloads, build folder structures, and run weekly cleanups.

## Install

Upload the ZIP via **Plugins > Upload Plugin** in Claude Cowork.

## What You Get

Install this plugin and the **Organize Machine** skill appears in your `/` menu. Say "organize my machine" and it runs the full flow, or use individual skills directly:

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Screenshot Scanner** | "Scan my screenshots" | Scans your Desktop for screenshots, describes each one, and suggests filenames and folders. Quick win — proves your agent can see and act on your files. |
| **GTD File Sorter** | "Sort my downloads" | Classifies files on Desktop and Downloads into GTD buckets (Action, Reference, Trash, Waiting) and moves them in batches with your approval. |
| **Folder Architect** | "Create a folder structure" | Asks 3 questions about how you work, picks a template, customizes it, builds the folders, then scans for files to move in. Works for any goal — tax season, freelance projects, creative work. |
| **Weekly Review** | "Run my weekly review" | Five-minute recurring cleanup. Scans Desktop and Downloads for new clutter, re-sorts into your existing structure, flags anything that needs attention. |

Say "organize my machine" and the router chains Screenshot Scanner, GTD File Sorter, and Folder Architect in sequence for the full first-time experience.
