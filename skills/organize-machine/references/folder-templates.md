## How to Pick: 3 Questions

Not sure which template fits you? Answer these:

**1. Do you work with clients or customers?**
- Yes, and I bill them individually → **Freelancer/Consultant**
- Yes, but it's more of a business with many customers → **Small Business Owner**
- No → Keep going

**2. What do you make most often?**
- Content (writing, videos, podcasts) → **Creator/Writer**
- Code or technical projects → **Developer**
- Homework and study materials → **Student**
- A mix of everything → **Default/General**

**3. Still not sure?**
- Start with **Default/General**. It works for everyone. You can always add more folders later. A simple system you actually use beats a complex system you ignore.
